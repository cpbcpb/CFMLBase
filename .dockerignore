#   TLDR: May want to include logs, .aws .env private keys, caches, .bakk backup files, 
#   test results, anything not needed in image
# or that might expose secrets or invalidate the cache because it updates so frequently

# You can include the Dockerfile in the .dockerignore.  This makes it harder for 
# consumers of the image to understand how it was built but it
# is a good idea of the Dockerfile contains any sensitive information.


#           Reduce docker image size

#           Prevent unintended secrets exposure
#               for example, 
#                .git .aws .env private keys cache and other files that are not needed in the docker build context
#               or the final Docker image.

#           The docker build cache invalidation.....
#                When copying in the webapp files for example, copying in 
#                   logs, test results, git history,
#                   temporary cache will regenerate this layer for every docker build run...

# Syntax not exactly the same as git ignore... see reference
